# **Bernoulli Mixture Models (BMM)**

This repository provides tools in a Python package *bmm_mix* for the statistical analysis of multivariate Bernoulli data using BMMs. 

## Maximum likelihood estimation 

Shows how to fit the model using [Expectation-Maximizition (EM)](https://github.com/AVoss84/bmm_mix/blob/master/EM_for_BMM.ipynb) algorithm as outlined in *Bishop (2006): Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*. 

## Bayesian estimation 

Shows how to fit the model using [Gibbs sampling](https://github.com/AVoss84/bmm_mix/blob/master/Gibbs_for_BMM.ipynb) algorithm.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
